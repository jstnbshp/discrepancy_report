## **1. Objective**

The objective of this project is to automate the generation and management of discrepancy reports between external Ad server data and internal pixel data using Google BigQuery. The system will allow for real-time data ingestion, automated report generation, easy editing and autosaving of notations, and machine learning-driven insights to enhance future reports.

## **2. Scope**

This project covers the following key aspects:
- **Data Ingestion**: Automating the import of external Ad server data from emails and the internal pixel dataset into Google BigQuery.
- **Data Processing**: Running automated queries to compare datasets and identify discrepancies, including checking for mismatched date ranges.
- **Reporting**: Generating and maintaining detailed discrepancy reports with historical data tracking.
- **Notation System**: Providing an interface for easy editing and autosaving of report notations, with the ability to leverage past notations for future reports.
- **Machine Learning**: Implementing machine learning models to predict notations based on historical data, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of report generation.

## **3. Requirements**

### **3.1 Functional Requirements**

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Automate the extraction of Ad server data from emails using Google Apps Script or Google Cloud Functions.
   - Load extracted data into Google BigQuery tables.
   - Regularly import internal pixel data into Google BigQuery.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Create SQL queries in BigQuery to compare Ad server data and internal pixel data.
   - Implement logic to verify and highlight mismatched date ranges between datasets.
   - Store the results of these queries in BigQuery tables or export them to a Google Sheet for further processing.

3. **Reporting**:
   - Use BigQuery to generate automated discrepancy reports at scheduled intervals.
   - Store historical reports in partitioned BigQuery tables to enable easy access and querying of past data.
   - Utilize Google Data Studio or a similar tool to create visualizations and dashboards for discrepancy reports.

4. **Notation System**:
   - Implement a Google Sheets-based interface or develop a custom web application for easy editing and autosaving of notations.
   - Ensure that all notation edits are autosaved and synced back to BigQuery.
   - Allow users to view and edit the date ranges related to discrepancies directly within the interface.

5. **Machine Learning**:
   - Utilize BigQuery ML to develop and train models on historical data for predicting notations on future reports.
   - Implement a feedback loop where user actions on suggested notations are logged and used to refine the machine learning model.
   - Continuously improve the model based on user feedback and evolving data patterns.

### **3.2 Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Scalability**:
   - The system must efficiently handle large datasets and scale seamlessly as data volumes increase.
   - All components should integrate smoothly with Google Cloud infrastructure to ensure scalability and reliability.

2. **Usability**:
   - The notation editing interface must be user-friendly, with features such as autosave, easy access to historical notations, and real-time collaboration.
   - Reports and dashboards should be easy to interpret, with clear visualization of discrepancies and relevant data.

3. **Security**:
   - Implement row-level security and access controls in BigQuery to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data.
   - Ensure that all data transfers and storage comply with relevant data privacy and security standards.

4. **Performance**:
   - Queries and data processing should be optimized for performance to ensure timely report generation and data updates.
   - The system should be responsive, with minimal latency in data ingestion, processing, and report generation.

### **3.3 Technical Requirements**

1. **Google BigQuery**:
   - Use BigQuery as the primary data storage and processing platform.
   - Implement partitioned and clustered tables for efficient storage and querying of historical data.

2. **Google Cloud Functions / Google Apps Script**:
   - Automate the extraction of Ad server data from emails using Google Cloud Functions or Google Apps Script.
   - Integrate these scripts with BigQuery for seamless data ingestion.

3. **Google Sheets / Custom Web Application**:
   - Develop an interface for editing and autosaving notations, either using Google Sheets or a custom web app built on Google App Engine or Firebase.
   - Ensure the interface supports real-time collaboration and is integrated with BigQuery.

4. **BigQuery ML**:
   - Use BigQuery ML to build and train machine learning models for predicting notations based on historical data.
   - Implement logic to incorporate user feedback into model training.

5. **Google Data Studio**:
   - Use Google Data Studio or similar tools for visualizing discrepancy reports and providing dashboards for users.

## **4. Timeline**

### **Phase 1: Prototype Development** (4-6 weeks)
- Set up initial data pipeline for Ad server and internal pixel data.
- Develop basic SQL queries for discrepancy analysis in BigQuery.
- Create a prototype interface for notation editing using Google Sheets.

### **Phase 2: Automation and Integration** (6-8 weeks)
- Automate data ingestion using Google Cloud Functions or Apps Script.
- Develop scheduled queries in BigQuery for regular report generation.
- Implement machine learning models in BigQuery ML for notation prediction.

### **Phase 3: User Testing and Feedback** (4 weeks)
- Conduct user testing on the notation interface and report generation process.
- Gather feedback and refine the system based on user input.
- Optimize performance and scalability.

### **Phase 4: Final Deployment and Training** (4 weeks)

- Provide training to users on the new system and gather initial feedback.
- Implement any final adjustments based on feedback.

## **5. Risks and Mitigations**

1. **Data Ingestion Failures**:
   - Risk: Issues with email extraction or data loading into BigQuery could delay report generation.
   - Mitigation: Implement robust error handling and logging in Cloud Functions/Apps Script, with alerts for failures.

2. **Machine Learning Model Accuracy**:
   - Risk: Initial models may not accurately predict notations, leading to incorrect suggestions.
   - Mitigation: Use a phased approach to model deployment, starting with simple models and gradually improving based on user feedback.

3. **User Adoption**:
   - Risk: Users may be resistant to adopting a new system.
   - Mitigation: Provide comprehensive training and support, and involve users early in the testing process to gather feedback and make adjustments.
