# Advertising Data Comparison and Discrepancy Report Automation

## Overview

This project automates the generation and management of discrepancy reports between external Ad server data and internal pixel data using Google BigQuery. It includes features such as automated data ingestion, report generation, a notation system with autosave capabilities, and machine learning-driven insights to enhance report accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Ingestion**: Extracts Ad server data from emails and ingests it into BigQuery.
- **Discrepancy Report Generation**: Automatically generates reports comparing Ad server data with internal pixel data.
- **Editable Notation System**: Allows users to easily add and autosave notations to reports.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Uses historical notations to predict and suggest future notations.

## Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Platform account
- Google BigQuery enabled
- Python 3.x installed locally
